	<h1>Information about 	Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

	<p>Time complexity is a way to measure how the running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows. It helps us understand how efficient a program is when solving a problem. An efficient algorithm uses less time and resources, even with large inputs. 
		Common time complexities include O(1), O(n), O(n²), 
		and more — the smaller the growth rate, 
		the more efficient the solution!</p>

	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a way to measure how much extra memory an algorithm needs to run, based on the size of its input. It tells us how efficiently a program uses memory while solving a problem. For example, if an algorithm needs memory directly proportional to the input size, we say its Space Complexity is O(n). Writing memory-efficient code helps programs run smoother, 
		especially when dealing with large data sets!</p>
